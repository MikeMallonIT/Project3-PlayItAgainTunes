## Motivation:

This assignment served as out final project to demonstrate what we learned during the past 6 months of SMU Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. Play It Again Tunes was developed with end-users in mind. We found that e-commerce website used for renting music equipment sometimes lack the soft-styling that we went for. We tried to keep Play It Again Tunes as user-friendly as possible while also retaining a clean, distraction-free front end.
